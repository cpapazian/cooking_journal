#### Chimichurri Sauce

This sauce really brings the Beef out of beef, particularly a skillet ribeye.

Add to a mason jar, food processed until fine:

- 1 cup packed fresh parsley, washed and dried
- 5 medium cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 tablespoons oregano leaves (if available)
- Â¼ cup sherry vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon chili

Cover with extra-virgin olive oil and let sit for a bit.
