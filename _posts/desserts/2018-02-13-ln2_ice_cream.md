This describes an ice cream base used at [tEp's](http://tep.mit.edu/) rush
events around 2008 to 2011. It's basically a really thick
[creme anglaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_anglaise), similar to
what you might find at most nth-wave ice cream shops in Boston.

## Make the Custard

* In a heavy-bottomed pot, simmer until fully dissolved:
  - 2 cups heavy cream
  - 1 cup whole milk
  - 2/3 cup sugar
  - 1/8 tsp fine sea salt
* Remove from heat.
* Whisk 6 egg yolks in a metal bowl. Still whisking, slowly add 1/3 of the
  heated cream mixture to yolks.
* Transfer yolk mixture to pot, slowly heating at medium-low until the custard
  coats the back of a spoon (i.e., heat it up to 170F).

Too hot or too long and you'll have sweet scrambled eggs. Yields ~4 cups total
and can be made and refrigerated ahead of time.

## Flavor the Custard

You can split a large quantity of ice cream base into different batches for
flavoring:

- Vanilla (Pods and extract)
- Green Tea (Matcha powder)
- Chocolate (cocoa powder, chunked or melted dark chocolate)
- Etc.

## Freeze the Custard

Use a Kitchen-Aid stand mixer on a low-speed setting, pouring a slow, steady,
patient stream of liquid nitrogen from the dewer until you have ice cream. Avoid
freezing it completely solid, as you can accidentally destroy the Kitchen-Aid
motor.

## Addendum: Allergic to Milk? Vegan?

Of course, not everyone is into animal proteins. The *Homemade Vegan Pantry*
says:

* Blend until creamy:
  - 1 cup cashews
  - 1/2 cups water
* Blend into cashew cream:
  - 1 (13 1/2 oz) can of full-fat coconut milk
  - 1/2 cup sugar.

Makes 4 cups total.

Note that you may need either a Vitamix, a strainer, or 24-hour soak of the
cashews to get a smooth texture.
