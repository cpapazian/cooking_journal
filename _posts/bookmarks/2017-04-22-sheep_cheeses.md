* Arpea de Brebis

Bought at Spanish Table on 4/22/2017.

Soft. Rind very salty. Like a more subtle and mushroomy
tallegio. Really delicious. -Maggie

Semisoft. Um. Hard crunchy rind.

* Roncal Sheep Cheese

Hard. Funky. Creamy. Put it in a mushroom quiche week of
4/18/2017. Bought it again the next week. Also from Spanish Table.
