Made a veggie quiche for breakfast with Tom and Katherine.

Night before we cooked down the spring onion (from Eatwell) and the
spinach and the kale. To cook down the spring onion, we chopped it
finely and sauteed it in a lot of butter until brown and the water was
evaporated. For the spinach and kale, we rinsed the greens and then
without drying the leaves, stuffed them in a pot and put the pot on a
hot burner. The greens will cook in their own liquid until they can
produce no more. I accidentally was not very attentive to the kale
boiling down and it burnt quite a bit on the bottom--this actually
produced a delicious kale chip style flavor to the quiche.

The next day we stirred the vegetables into the egg and milk mixture
and poured it into two pie crusts that Kelliott had picked up from
Safeway. I originally thought that two quiches would be one quiche too
many, but it turned out to work out great.
