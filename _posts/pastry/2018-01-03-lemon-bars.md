Based on
[Slate's recipe](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/04/11/best_lemon_bar_recipe_zest_and_lots_of_fresh_lemon_juice_are_key.html). We
frequently substitute in Meyer lemons for regular ones, which is **amazing**.

For the crust:
- Mix together and blend into a coarse meal
  * 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 3/4 cup powdered sugar, plus more for garnish
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 cup (2 sticks) butter
- Press into a 9-inch greased pan.
- Bake at 350F until edges are brown (~20 minutes)

For the filling:
- Whisk until smooth
  * 6 large eggs
  * 2 1/4 cups sugar
- Stir in until just combined
  * 1 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
  * 3 tablespoons grated lemon zest
- Fold in
  * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Pour filing into baked crust and bake until firm at 315F (~45
minutes).
