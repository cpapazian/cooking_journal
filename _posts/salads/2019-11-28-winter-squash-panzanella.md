I made this salad for a Thanksgiving potluck at [Mapbox][mbx], wanting to make
something vegan with the bounty of butternut squash from our CSA. Panzanella is
definitely a 'pattern salad': a base of toasted (or stale) bread moistened and
combined with other stuff. You can (and should!) replace the primary vegetable,
toppings, and dressing with whatever is currently in-season. This recipe itself
is based on the panzanella in Marcella Hazan's [Essentials of Classic Italian
Cooking][hazan] (which is tomato and anchovy-based), and suggestions from
friends at the [Garden for the Environment][gfe] at an event the night before
the potluck.

The salad components can be prepped the day before, *except* for the vegetable
toppings (radishes, etc.). Prep those at the time of serving.

Salad dressing
- 1 cup olive oil
- 2 tbsp sherry vinegar
- 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 4 tbsp salt-packed capers
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, mortared with the capers
- 1 tsp whole-grain mustard

Squash
- 4 whole butternut squash, cut in-half and sliced into 1/2-inch half-moons
- Toss with salt, olive oil, white pepper
- Roast on parchment at 400F until caramelized at the edges

Bread
- 1 loaf sourdough, cut into 1-inch cubes, tossed lightly in olive oil, and
  broiled to golden brown. I used a whole [Tartine][tartine] country loaf, but
  any substantial, high-gluten broad loaf works.

Toppings
- shallots, sliced and macerated in apple cider vinegar
- radishes, sliced
- chives, diced
- arugula, washed
- roasted Whole Hazelnuts, chopped

After making the dressing, squash, bread, and toppings, assemble the salad
30-minutes prior to serving:
1. In a large mixing bowl, toss and roughly combine the bread and the
   squash. Add salad dressing and let sit for 10-15 minutes.
2. Add arugula and mix, followed by shallots, chives, and half of the hazelnuts.
3. Adjust seasoning with salt and white pepper.
4. Cover with remaining hazelnuts and radishes.
