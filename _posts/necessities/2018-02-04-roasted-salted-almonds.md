title: Roasted, Salted Almonds
category: necessities
---

For hikes and backpacking trips! It's based on this [recipe][recipe]. We
frequently use [huā jiāo][peppercorn], but really, lots of
[flavor profiles][tjs] can work here.

For each 4 1/2 cups raw almonds:
- Dissolve in 1 1/2 tsp salt in 1 1/2 tbsp boiling water.
- Mix/coat almonds with salt water.
- Spread out on silpat on a baking sheet.
- Cook for 15-20 minutes (until browned inside and out) at 375F, stirring
  halfway through for even cooking.
- Mix/coat almonds with 2 tbsp olive oil, coating with additional salt, sugar,
  and seasonings as desired.
- Spread out to cool for at least an hour.

**Do not burn** the almonds! 375F might simply be too hot.
