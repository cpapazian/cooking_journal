This is a recipe for a soft cashew cheese spread, in the style of what you may
find from Miyoko's Creamery.

Mix together into a food processor and blend until smooth:
- 500g soaked cashews (simmered and soaked overnight)
- 1 tbsp miso
- 2 tbsp fermented tofu
- 1/4 cup pickle brine (lactofermented)
- 2 tbsp sherry vinegar
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)

Empty into a glass bowl, cover with a secured cheesecloth, and leave to ferment
in a sunny area (probably for a few weeks?).
