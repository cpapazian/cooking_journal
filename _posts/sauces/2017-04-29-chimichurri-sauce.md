This sauce really brings the Beef out of beef, particularly a skillet ribeye.

Add to a mason jar, food processed until fine:

- 2 cups packed fresh parsley, washed and dried
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 tablespoons oregano leaves (if available)
- 2 tbsp sherry vinegar, optionally steeped with chilis
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon chili

Cover with extra-virgin olive oil and let sit for a bit.
