This is a Bengali variant of a fruit [aachar][aachar]/preserve that can be made
with unripe, local stone fruit. Mangoes and olives variants work well too,
although I haven't tried them yet. The recipe itself a based on some commentary
from an aunt, whose aachar is quite popular within my extended family.

* Add unripe stone fruit (e.g., peaches), washed and cut coarsely, and some
  water (~ 1/2 cup) to a small, heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a simmer.
* Add sugars, about half weight of stone fruit, to pot:
  - Brown sugar
  - 3-4 tbsp, honey
  - 1 tbsp, pomegranate molasses
  - **OR** [Nolen gur][gur]
  - For sourness: tamarind paste (whole)
* Simmer fruit and sugar and let reduce. Cool some on the back of a spoon to
  test final consistency and aim for something jam-like.
* Fold in spices:
  - 1 tbsp [Panch phoron][panch], ground and fried in mustard oil (~ 2 tsp)
  - Pinch of [Hing][hing] (resin, not the powder)
  - [Black salt][salt], as needed

I eyeballed this the first time I made it, and the volume measurements are
calibrated for about 400g of fruit (with cores removed).
