title: Habanero Piri Piri
category: sauces
---

We frequently refer to any olive oil-citrus-based chili sauce as 'Piri Piri',
even if the eponymous [chilies][wiki] aren't involved. This recipe uses
lactofermented Habaneros, which have great depth, but any other hot pepper could
work just as well.

Food process until fully emulsified:
  * 5 - 8 pickled habaneros, stemmed and deseeded
  * 2 - 3 garlic cloves
  * 5 tbsp olive oil
  * 4 tbsp lemon juice
  * 1 tbsp sherry vinegar
  * 1 tsp salt
