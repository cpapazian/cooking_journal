title: Lacto-Fermented Butternut Squash Spread
category: sauces
---

This attempts to reproduce a fermented squash spread I had at at
[Bar Tartine](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-tartine-san-francisco)
forever ago. It's also a great way to procrastinate on CSA squash.

For the cultured squash:
- Peel a butternut squash and cut into ribbons or 1-inch blocks.
- In a large sealable jar, add cut pieces and the squash top to a 5%
  salt brine (~800g total brine probably). Weigh down so that squash
  is submerged.
- Wait!

After a month or more, when sample squash is sour and savory:
- Peel and steam until tender a second butternut squash.
- Add fermented squash, steamed squash, and 1/2 cup tahini (optional)
  to a food processor and process until smooth.
- Add squash brine as needed for salt and texture.

Any remaining seeds here can be toasted in a neutral oil.
