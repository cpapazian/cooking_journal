This is a recipe for the lemongrass-chile sauce similar to what's available at
[Mau][mau] in SF. It's modified from Viet World Kitchen's recipe
[online][recipe].

* Mince:
  - 30g garlic
  - 30g shallots
  - 90g lemongrass
  - 10g fresh Thai bird chilis, deseeded
  - 30g dried red chili
  - 2 tbsp dried shrimp, rehydrated in hot water
* In a wok, start 1 cup of grapeseed oil at medium low and add the garlic. Once
  frothing, lower heat to low (a gentle tremble) until the garlic sinks (about 5
  minutes). Repeat with shallots and lemongrass (~10 minutes).
* Add dried shrimp, fresh, and dried chiles, frying each separately for 5
  minutes each.
* Add:
  - 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar
  - 3 tablespoons fish sauce
  - 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* Cook for a few minutes more. Cool and food process.
