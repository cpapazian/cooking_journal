From David Chang and Peter Meehan in the Momofuku Cookbook.

* 1/2 cup fish sauce
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 1 lime, juiced
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 to 3 red birdâ€™s-eye chiles, sliced

Some reminders:
- **Don't forget** to wear gloves while handling the bird chilis!
- In a pinch, apple cider vinegar can be used instead.
